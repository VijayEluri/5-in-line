Tic-tac-toe game on a board > 5 x 5. It's an old school project from
2003, that was improved in 2004. It was developed with a classmate who
implemented the minimax algorithm. Unfortunately, that algorithm got
lost somehow and it's unavailable in the current version.

The last time I tested it worked fine with java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel-1.7.0.3-2.1.fc16.1.x86_64.
